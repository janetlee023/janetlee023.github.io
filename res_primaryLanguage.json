I have had the opporunity of dabbling in different realms of software development and am currently working with C# and ASP.NET. I also am working on a start-up which uses React! Keeping my skills sharp when I can. I am always looking to expand my skillset and tone my skills at hand. When grad school gives me the time, I try to be outdoors as much as possible! Snowboarding, longboarding, camping/hiking, and traveling to name a few!",
